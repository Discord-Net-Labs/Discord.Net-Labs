## What is Discord.NET Labs?

Discord.NET Labs is an experimental fork of Discord.NET that implements the newest discord features for testing and development to eventually get merged into Discord.NET. Serving as a developer branch to the default project, it is a drop in replacement and can be used instead. It is ill advised to use Discord.NET Labs in a production environment normally. However if approached correctly, will work as an improved and up-to-date  replacement to Discord.NET!

### Slash commands

Slash commands are purposed to take over the normal message command in Discord and exposes a lot more from the user that it applies to.

- [Guides](xref:Guides.SlashCommands.Intro)

### Message & User commands

These commands can be pointed at messages and users, in custom application tabs. These commands are interactions as well, and are able to be handled just like slashcommands. 
They do not have options however.

- [Guides](xref:Guides.ContextCommands.Creating)
