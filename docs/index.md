## What is Discord.NET?

Discord.Net is an asynchronous, multi-platform .NET Library used to
interface with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/).

## Where to begin?

If this is your first time using Discord.Net, you should refer to the
[Intro](xref:Guides.Introduction) for tutorials.

If you're coming from Discord.NET V2, 
consider checking out [what has changed](xref:Guides.V2V3Guide).

More experienced users might want to refer to the
[API Documentation](xref:API.Docs) for a breakdown of the individual
objects in the library.

## Nightlies

Nightlies are builds of Discord.NET that are still in an experimental phase, and have not been released.
These are not included in the main repository, and are instead taken over by [Discord.NET Labs].

Discord.NET Labs is an experimental fork of Discord.NET that implements the newest discord features
for testing and development to eventually get merged into Discord.NET.

## Questions?

Frequently asked questions are covered in the 
FAQ. Read it thoroughly because most common questions are already answered there. 

If you still have unanswered questions after reading the [FAQ](xref:FAQ.Basics.GetStarted), further support is available on 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/dnet).

## New in V3

### Interaction Framework

A counterpart to the well-known command service of Discord.NET, the Interaction Framework implements the same
feature-rich structure to register & handle interactions like application commands & buttons.
